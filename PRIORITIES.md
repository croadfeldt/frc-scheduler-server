# FRC Match Scheduler — Placement Priorities & Technical Reference

## Match Placement Priorities (P1–P10)

These rules govern how teams are placed into match slots during abstract schedule generation (Stage 1). Rules are applied in priority order — higher priority rules are never violated to satisfy lower priority ones.

| Priority | Rule | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| P1 | No surrogate in last match | A surrogate team must not appear in the final match of the schedule |
| P2 | No surrogate in first match | A surrogate team must not appear in the first match of the schedule |
| P3 | Cooldown enforcement | A team must not play again within `cooldown` matches of their last appearance |
| P4 | Alliance balance | Each match must have exactly 3 red and 3 blue teams |
| P5 | No repeat opponents | Teams should not face the same opponent more than necessary |
| P6 | No repeat partners | Teams should not partner with the same team more than necessary |
| P7 | Surrogate placement | Surrogates must be clearly identified and placed in early-middle matches |
| P8 | Back-to-back minimisation | Minimise matches where a team plays consecutive matches |
| P9 | Imbalance minimisation | Minimise the difference between a team's red and blue appearances |
| P10 | Repeat minimisation | Minimise total repeat opponents and partners across the schedule |

## Surrogate Rules

When `numTeams × matchesPerTeam` is not evenly divisible by 6 (teams per match), some teams play one extra match as a "surrogate". Surrogate teams are identified during abstract schedule generation.

Post-generation sweep rules (applied after Stage 1 completes):
- **R1:** No surrogate in first or last match — surrogates are moved to an early-middle position by swapping with a regular team
- **R2:** Surrogate swap preserves alliance balance — the swap must not create an imbalanced match

---

## Break Buffer

`breakBuffer` (default 5 min, URL param `bb`) controls when to stop scheduling matches before a break or end of day.

**Rule:** Schedule a match if its start time is at least `breakBuffer` minutes before the break:
```
breakStart - cursor >= breakBuffer
```

The cycle time does **not** factor into this check. A match that clears the buffer is committed to run even if its cycle time overlaps the break start.

Times in FIRST agenda PDFs are local event time — no timezone information is present or needed.

### Fit metrics

| Metric | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| Total matches needed | `ceil(teams × mpt / 6)` |
| Surrogates | `totalMatches × 6 − teams × mpt` |
| Time needed | `totalMatches × cycleTime` |
| Time available | Sum of parsed qual block durations |
| Buffer / Overflow | `available − needed` |
| Capacity % | `needed / available × 100` |
| Matches / Hour | `60 / cycleTime` |
| Max cycle to fit | `available / totalMatches` |

**Status thresholds:** ✓ Comfortable (≤85%) / ⚠ Tight (≤100%) / ✗ Over Capacity (>100%)

### Auto flags

| Flag | ID | Default | Trigger |
|------|----|---------|---------|
| Auto-apply PDF agenda | `autoPopulate` | ✅ On | Debounced Stage 1 regeneration on param change (1.5s debounce) |
| `autoApplyAgenda` | ✅ On | Calls `applyAgendaToSchedule()` automatically after successful PDF parse |
| Auto-calculate max matches/team | `autoMaxCycles` | ☐ Off | Calls `calcMaxMatches()` after day config is applied (auto or manual) |

### Apply to Day Configuration

`applyAgendaToSchedule()` algorithm:
1. Group `_agendaBlocks` by `b.day` label → `dayMap` / `dayOrder`
2. Set `numDays` and call `buildDaysUI()`
3. Per day: `.day-start` = `min(block.start)`, `.day-end` = `max(block.end)`
4. Gaps between consecutive blocks → `addBreak()` calls (label = "Lunch" if ≥30 min, "Break" otherwise)
5. Call `applyDayEndTimes()` then `validateTimesAndRecalc()`
6. If `autoMaxCycles` on → call `calcMaxMatches()`

## Day/Night Mode

`[data-theme="light"]` attribute on `<html>` overrides all CSS custom properties to light palette values. `toggleTheme()` sets/clears the attribute and updates the 🌙/☀️ button. `initTheme()` IIFE reads `localStorage.getItem('frc_theme')` on load and applies preference before first render. Default: dark (Catppuccin Mocha).

## TBA Event Dropdown

- Year-specific fetch: `GET /api/tba/events/{year}` — events sorted by `start_date` ascending in `tba.py`; no row cap
- Cross-year fallback: when `visibleCount < 3 && query.length >= 2`, augments dropdown from `_tbaSearchIndex` (TBA global search index, all years) under "Other years" separator
- Search index pre-fetched 2s after page load via `ensureTbaSearchIndex()`
- Source badges: `TBA` (blue `var(--accent)`) / `FRC` (green `var(--accent3)`)
- FRC Events credential errors surfaced immediately in `showApiStatus` (not hidden in dropdown)

## Stage 2 Simulated Annealing

`assign_teams()` in `scheduler.py`:
- Budget: `num_teams × 2` steps per iteration (matches old hill-climber)
- `T0 = 500`, linear cooling
- 2-swap moves; accept worse when `exp(Δ/T)` and `Δ/T > -10`
- Score: `-(b2b×1000 + imbalance×500 + surrogates×200 + repeat_opp×15 + repeat_part×12)`
- ~90ms/iter per worker; best result across all workers kept
